<h1>Hacking the MBA</h1>

Everyone I know who works in technology is self-taught.

Today, most Universities offer only a handful of technology classes or degree programs. This is why the technology hungry generally take it upon themselves to learn. But Universities do need to catch up, and that’s why I’ve been teaching in my spare time over the past five years.

My First MBA Class This Spring I taught my first MBA class. My alma matter, Southern Methodist University, had invited me to teach an MBA course in the marketing. The class was a survey of digital marketing and spanned paid, owned and earned media.

These MBA students were much different than the undergrads or executives I previously taught. Many already had significant professional experience. Most had clear ideas about the trajectory of their careers. A good deal of them were footing their own bill. Most importantly, every last one of them were interested, engaged and eager for an education in digital.

A Case for Cases Early on, I kept hearing from peers and the students that most MBA courses include the use of business “cases.” Professors introduce a core lesson or principle and the cases help demonstrate how a specific company tackled a real-world problem, and the results.

Sounded simple enough, but it quickly became apparent that even the most notable business case resources left me with three challenges:

1. Selection was small: There are few published digital cases. This is particularly true in digital marketing.

2. Cases were outdated: They included outdated data or platforms, and did not include the latest digital marketing concepts.

3. Lack of detail: Cases are written by academics who aren’t given full access to digital data, so results and insights were limited.

The Assignment I wanted to give my students a final project where they could leverage real data for insights, and a real business scenario to inspire them. Cases wouldn’t provide this, and real businesses are reticent to share data.

I remembered an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use">article in The Verge from last year about a startup that folded and made all their data available online for other entrepreneurs to learn from.</a>

That startup was called Everpix. They had built a great product with a loyal customer base, but failed to receive the funding they needed because of the series A crunch. The Verge had covered their last days, and one of the Founders, Pierre-Olivier Latour, had <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use">uploaded a treasure trove of insights from the company to Github</a> — VC pitch decks, analytics, monthly investor updates, and much more. The data and scenario for a digital marketing assignment was a perfect fit. Everpix had built a produce people loved, but had failed to grow.

My final assignment for the class was simple:

Pick up where Everpix left off. You received your series A. $1 million (a nice round number for budgeting) must be used to grow users. Tell me how you’ll spend the money and what you expect to get in return. Each team was required to address paid, owned and earned strategies.

As the teams began to prepare, I reached out to Everpix founder Pierre-Olivier Latour. He was gracious enough to answer questions for the teams. In addition, he asked that we reciprocate his original gesture and share our final presentations with the world.

You can see all the final presentations here. They do not look like presentations from students with little to no digital marketing experience. Access to real data and a real business inspired the students. They felt as if this was their own product, and it shows. That would not have happened with a business case or a hypothetical.

Long Live Everpix
